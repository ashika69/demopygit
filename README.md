# Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction --- @ashika69

## Overview

This project aims to predict the compressive strength of concrete using machine learning techniques. The dataset used contains various features of the concrete mix, such as cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, and age. The target variable is the concrete compressive strength.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is "concrete_data.csv". It contains 1030 instances with 9 features. The features are:

- **cement** (kg/m^3)
- **blastFurnace** (kg/m^3)
- **flyAsh** (kg/m^3)
- **water** (kg/m^3)
- **superplasticizer** (kg/m^3)
- **courseAggregate** (kg/m^3)
- **fineaggregate** (kg/m^3)
- **age** (days)
- **strength** (MPa)

## Methodology

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - The dataset is loaded using Pandas.
   - Feature names are renamed for better readability.
   - Data is analyzed for missing values, duplicates, and data types.
   - Duplicates are removed.
   - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the data distribution and relationships between features.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - PowerTransformer is applied to make the data more Gaussian-like.
   - StandardScaler is used to scale the features.

3. **Model Selection and Training:**
   - Various regression models are evaluated, including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
   - XGBoost is selected as the best performing model based on R-squared score.
   - Cross-validation is used to further improve the model's performance and tune hyperparameters.

4. **Prediction:**
   - A prediction system is implemented using the trained XGBoost model.
   - The system takes input values for the concrete mix features and predicts the compressive strength.

## Results

- The XGBoost model achieves a high R-squared score on both the training and testing datasets.
- The prediction system provides accurate estimates of concrete compressive strength.

## Usage

To use the prediction system:

1. Install the required libraries
2. 2. Load the trained XGBoost model.
3. Input the values for the concrete mix features.
4. Run the prediction function to get the predicted compressive strength.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting concrete compressive strength. The trained XGBoost model can be used to assist engineers in designing concrete mixes with desired strength properties.
